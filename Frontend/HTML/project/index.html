WWE brands its product as <a style="color: rgb(28, 28, 174)" href="">sports entertainment</a>, acknowledging professional wrestling's roots in competitive sport and dramatic theater.

        Vincent J. McMahon and Toots Mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately 70% of the NWA's booking power, largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated 
        <!--link tag--><a href="" style="color: rgb(28, 28, 174)">Northeastern United States</a>. 
        In 1963, McMahon and Mondt had a dispute with the NWA over 
        <!--link tag--><a href="" style="color: rgb(28, 28, 174)">"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers</a> 
        being booked to hold the

In a now infamous situation, the NWA sent former five-time world champion and legitimate wrestler 
        <!--link tag--><a href="" style="color: rgb(28, 28, 174)">Lou Thesz</a> 
        to Toronto to face Rogers on January 24, 1963. Thesz recalls this was not planned and prior to the match remembered telling Buddy "we can do this the easy way or the hard way." Rogers agreed to lose the fall and title in a one fall match versus the traditional two out of three fall matchup that most world title matches were defended. Once word reached back to Mondt and McMahon, at first they simply ignored the title change. From January until April 1963, Rogers was promoted as the NWA World Champion, or simply the World Heavyweight Champion, in their area. The World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) was not an immediate creation after Rogers's one fall loss to Thesz. Mondt and McMahon both eventually left the NWA in protest and formed the WWWF in the process. They brought along with them Willie Gilzenberg, long time boxing and wrestling promoter in New Jersey. In April 1963, the 
        <!--link tag--><a href="" style="color: rgb(28, 28, 174)"> WWWF World Heavyweight Championship </a>
        was created, with the promotion claiming that inaugural champion Rogers had won a tournament in Rio de Janeiro on April 25, 1963, defeating long time Capitol favorite Antonino Rocca in the finals. In reality, Rocca was no longer in the area, as he was working for Jim Crockett Sr. in the Carolinas. Rogers also had already suffered what would later be a career ending heart attack on April 18 in Akron, Ohio, and was in an Ohio hospital during the time the alleged tournament took place.
        <!--superscript tag--><sup><!--link tag--><a href="" style="color: rgb(28, 28, 174)">[23]</a></sup> 
        Rogers lost the championship to Bruno Sammartino a month later on May 17, with the promotion beginning to be built around Sammartino shortly after.

        he younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. The actual date of sale is still unknown but the generally accepted date is June 6, 1982; however this was likely only the date the deal was struck but not finalized. On WWF television, Capitol Wrestling Corporation maintained copyrights and ownership past the June 1982 date. The World Wrestling Federation was not solely owned by Vincent J. McMahon but also by 
        <!--link tag--><a href="" style="color: rgb(28, 28, 174)">Gorilla Monsoon, Arnold Skaaland</a> 
        and Phil Zacko. The deal between the two McMahons was a monthly payment basis where if a single payment was missed, ownership would revert to the elder McMahon and his business partners. Looking to seal the deal quickly, McMahon took several loans and deals with other promoters and the business partners (including the promise of a job for life) in order to take full ownership by May or June 1983 for an estimated total of roughly $1 million with the three business partners receiving roughly $815,000 among them and Vincent J. McMahon receiving roughly $185,000.

McMahon was quoted as saying: "In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling.
