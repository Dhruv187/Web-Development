              Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies were initially produced by Leon
              Schlesinger and animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising from 1930
              to 1933.[3] Schlesinger assumed full production from 1933 until he
              sold his studio to Warner Bros. in 1944, after which it was
              renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons.[3] The Looney Tunes title was
              inspired by that of Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies.[3] The shorts
              initially showcased musical compositions owned by Warner's music
              publishing interests through the adventures of such characters as
              Bosko and Buddy.[3] However, the shorts gained a higher profile
              upon the debuts of directors Tex Avery, Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones,
              and Bob Clampett and voice actor Mel Blanc later in the decade.[3]
              Porky Pig and Daffy Duck became the featured Looney Tunes
              characters, while Merrie Melodies featured one-shot cartoons and
              minor recurring characters.[3] After Bugs Bunny became popular in
              the Merrie Melodies shorts of the early 1940s, Looney Tunes moved
              from black and white to color production, Merrie Melodies having
              already been in color since 1934.[3] The two series gradually lost
              their distinctions, and shorts were assigned to each series
              arbitrarily.[3] From 1942 to 1964, Looney Tunes and Merrie
              Melodies were the most popular animated shorts in movie
              theaters.[4]

            <p>
              Courage the Cowardly Dog follows Courage (Marty Grabstein), a kind
              yet easily frightened dog. He was abandoned as a puppy after his
              parents were sent into outer space by a crazed veterinarian.[3]
              Soon after, he was found in an alleyway by Muriel Bagge (Thea
              White), a caring woman who decided to take Courage in as her own;
              the nature of this first meeting inspired her to give him his
              name. In the present, Courage lives in an isolated farmhouse with
              Muriel and her husband Eustace Bagge (Lionel Wilson in episodes
              1‚Äì33, Arthur Anderson in episodes 34‚Äì52), a cranky and greedy man
              who is jealous of Courage, refers to him as "stupid dog", and
              periodically uses the "Ooga Booga" mask to frighten him. The
              nearest town to the farmhouse is called Nowhere. Courage and his
              owners frequently encounter monsters, aliens, zombies, and other
              paranormal or supernatural creatures that are attracted to
              Nowhere. Plots generally use conventions common to horror films.
              Although most of the creatures the three face are hostile, others
              suffer from distress, anger, and/or desperation, and sometimes are
              friendly.The task of protecting Muriel and Eustace from such
              dangers falls on Courage, who endeavors to thwart or reconcile
              with the monster of the week and remedy or repair any damages
              done. Although Courage is occasionally aided with that task, the
              full extent of his efforts is usually performed unbeknownst to
              Muriel and Eustace. Ironically, given his name, Courage may be
              considered a genuine hero who often goes to great lengths to
              protect his owners, and a genuine coward who still expresses much
              of his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks.

              Jafar, a sorcerer and the royal vizier of the Middle Eastern city
              of Agrabah, seeks a lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders that
              only "the diamond in the rough" can retrieve. Meanwhile, Princess
              Jasmine is unsatisfied with her sheltered life in the palace. One
              day, she escapes the palace and encounters a street urchin,
              Aladdin, and his pet monkey, Abu. As a bond between Aladdin and
              Jasmine develops, Jafar has the palace guards capture Aladdin,
              during which Jasmine reveals herself. She confronts Jafar to
              demand Aladdin's release, but he lies to her, stating that Aladdin
              has already been beheaded. Disguised as an elderly beggar, Jafar
              frees Aladdin and Abu and orders them to retrieve the lamp from
              the cave. The guardian grants Aladdin entry, but warns him to
              touch only the lamp. Aladdin finds both the lamp and a magic
              carpet inside, but Abu grabs a large jewel and triggers a cave-in.
              Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, who throws him and Abu into the
              cave, although not before Abu steals it back. Later, Aladdin rubs
              the lamp and meets the Genie, who lives inside. The Genie grants
              Aladdin three wishes, although Aladdin tricks him to free them
              from the cave without using a wish. On learning the Genie's desire
              to be released from servitude, Aladdin promises to use his last
              wish to free him. To woo Jasmine, Aladdin uses his first wish to
              become a prince.
