          HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
          content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
          technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
          languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from
          a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
          multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
          semantically and originally included cues for its appearance. HTML
          elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
          images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded
          into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
          documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
          paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are
          delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.HTML can embed
          programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which
          affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS
          defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
          standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational
          HTML since 1997.A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display
          video and audio, primarily using the element, together with
          JavaScript.

          Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime
          environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
          Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code
          outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write
          command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run
          JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web
          page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
          Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,
          unifying web-application development around a single programming
          language, as opposed to using different languages for the server-
          versus client-side programming. Node.js has an event-driven
          architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to
          optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many
          input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications
          (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
          markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
          SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
          Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the
          separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
          fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility;[further
          explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
          pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
          .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
          content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
          load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
          the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
          methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
          browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS
          also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on
          a mobile device.

          React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
          front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on
          components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
          community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to
          develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with
          frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user
          interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications
          often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side
          functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders
          those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary
          rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
