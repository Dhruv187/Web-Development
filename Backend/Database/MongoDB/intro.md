# What is MongoDb ?

-> MongoDb is a NoSQL Document based Database
-> It has strong support for Aggregation pipes (The aggregation pipeline in MongoDB is a way to process and analyze data inside the database. Think of it like an assembly line (pipeline) where documents pass through multiple stages, and at each stage, something happens (filtering, grouping, sorting, reshaping,Â etc.).)
-> Works on BSON format
-> Best for node application

# Example

{
"name": "John",
"age":27,
"skills":["python", "html","javascript"]
}
