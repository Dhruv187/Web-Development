      /><span>I found a personal narrative essay on **Edubirdie** that describes the
        author's first love experience. The author writes, "Love is transcendent
        and universal, unable to be bound <img
        alt="flower"
        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Sunflower_from_Silesia2.jpg"

      />by the constraint of hatred. It is an
        inhabitant human instinct that we are unable to deny. A feeling of being
        desired that we all strive for.</span>
      My first love was cosmic, it danced among the stars and burned in
      supernovas. It etched its imprint into my soul." Â² If you would like to
      write your own paragraph about your first love, here's a template to get
      you started: > My first love was [insert your own description here]. I
      felt [insert your own feelings here] when I was with them. We [insert your
      own experience here]. Even though it didn't last, I will always remember
      my first love fondly. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other
      questions.
